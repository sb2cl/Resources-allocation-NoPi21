# Resources-allocation-NoPi21
Contains the Matlab code and data files used in the paper: Resources allocation explains the differential roles of RBS and promoter strengths in cell mass distribution and optimal protein expression productivity.

The subfolders within /SI_software include the self-contained Matlab scripts required to produce the results included in the figures of the main text of the paper.

For the parameters fitting we used the global optimizaiton software MEIGO (see Methods 5.3 in the main text) which is available at:
      http://gingproc.iim.csic.es/meigo.html
      
We used experimental data mainly obtained from:
      (1) Bremer, H. and Dennis, P. P., Modulation of Chemical Composition and Other Parameters of the Cell by Growth Rate, EcoSal Plus, 20018
      (2) Hausser, Jean and Mayo, Avi and Keren, Leeat and Alon, Uri, Central dogma rates and the trade-off between precision and economy in gene expression, Nature Communications, 10(1), 2019.
      
The data from (1) can be found as Matlab matrices in the scripts using it. The data we used from (2) can be found in the Excel file coliRates.xlsx
