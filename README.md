# Resources-allocation-NoPi21
Contains the Matlab code and data files used in the paper: Resources allocation explains the differential roles of RBS and promoter strengths in cell mass distribution and optimal protein expression productivity.

The subfolders within /SI_software include the self-contained Matlab scripts required to produce the results included in the figures of the main text of the paper.

For the parameters fitting we used the global optimizaiton software MEIGO (see Methods 5.3 in the main text) which is available at:
