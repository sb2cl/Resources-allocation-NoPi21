# Resources-allocation-NoPi21
Contains the Matlab code and data files used in the paper: RBS and promoter strengths determine the cell growth-dependent protein mass fractions and their optimal synthesis rates.

The subfolders include the self-contained Matlab scripts required to produce the results included in the figures both in the main text and the SI of the paper.

For the parameters fitting we used the global optimizaiton software MEIGO (see Methods 5.3 in the main text) which is available at:
      http://gingproc.iim.csic.es/meigo.html
      
We used experimental data mainly obtained from:
      (1) Bremer, H. and Dennis, P. P., Modulation of Chemical Composition and Other Parameters of the Cell by Growth Rate, EcoSal Plus, 20018
     and (2) Hausser, Jean and Mayo, Avi and Keren, Leeat and Alon, Uri, Central dogma rates and the trade-off between precision and economy in gene expression, Nature Communications, 10(1), 2019.
      
The data from (1) can be found as Matlab matrices in the scripts using it. The data we used from (2) can be found in the Excel file coliRates.xlsx
